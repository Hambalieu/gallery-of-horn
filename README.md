# Lab 1 Gallery of Horns 

- By the end of this week, I  am to  create an application that displays images and information of horned animals. This application will allow you to filter the images by number of horns and chose your favorite image.

- But for todays lab 1 was focusing more on the compunent of the App .I created a new React Application and then filled it with components.

- The Component that I created are the:
1. Header Component
   > The Header contains the heading of my App
2. Main Component
  > Main displays 2 images of animals 
3. Footer Component
  > Footer displays a copyright 

- I also  did some CSS styling for my App.
