# Gallery of Horns 

- By the end of this week, I  am to  create an application that displays images and information of horned animals. This application will allow you to filter the images by number of horns and chose your favorite image.

- But for todays *Lab 4* was focusing more on adding more pieces of functionality to my App  **fitering** by numbers of horns using a **Forms** displayed.
